Dashboard: This is the main page users see when they log in. It could display an overview of the current DHCP settings, such as the range of IP addresses being managed, the number of devices currently connected, and any other relevant statistics.

Devices: This page could list all the devices that have been assigned an IP address by the DHCP server. For each device, you might display information like the device's MAC address, the IP address it's been assigned, and the time it was last seen.

Static IP Management: This page would allow users to assign static IP addresses to specific devices. Users could add a new static IP assignment by entering a device's MAC address and the IP address they want to assign to it. The page could also list all current static IP assignments and allow users to edit or delete them.

DNS Settings: This page would allow users to manage DNS settings for the network. They could specify the DNS server that devices should use, and possibly configure other DNS-related settings.

Logs: This page could display logs from the DHCP server, helping users troubleshoot issues or monitor the server's activity.

Settings: This page would allow users to configure the DHCP server. They could specify the range of IP addresses to be managed, the lease time for IP addresses, and any other configurable settings.
